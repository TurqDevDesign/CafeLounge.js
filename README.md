# CafeLoungeJS

**Lightweight, Open Source Javascript library: CafeLoungeJS**

Simply and easily develop your Javascript plugins without the need for an exhaustive library, bogged down by unnecessary features. Pick and choose what you need! No more making users download huge files when less than 1% of the code will be used!

**Note: CafeLoungeJS is still in development. The features you see are usable but not fully refined. You're welcome to give it a try if you're feeling adventurous, you can find semi-detailed documentation in the code comments.**
**In the future I plan to create a tool which will allow you to generate a file containing the individual features that you need, allowing for a new system of Javascript libraries. My hope for the future is that we'll be able to implement pre-written functions to our heart's content, excluding everything we don't need, alleviating unnecessary bytes and load time!**
